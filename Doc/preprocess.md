# Image Preprocessing

### origin given images is small and mirrored, some characters are too thin to distinguish, and the number of images may not enough to tarin character set. So we preprocess the images with some mathematical morphology methods
* Interpolation to enlarge the image
* Dilation to make character easier to detect and separate
* Separation to recognition one line
* Rotation to get more training data

### Interpolation

### Separation

### Dilation

### Rotation
